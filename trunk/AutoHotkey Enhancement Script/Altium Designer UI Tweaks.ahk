[Altium Designer UI Tweaks]
version = 0.004

Description:
This is an AutoHotkey script, and thus requires that AutoHotkey be installed. Tested with
AutoHotkey_L, which can be found at http://l.autohotkey.net/
This script provides several enhancements to Altium Designer, such as limited autocomplete
for filter expressions, improved mouse wheel support, and various tweaks to save time on
frequently-used tasks.


Definitions:
LMB : Left Mouse Button
MMB : Middle Mouse Button
RMB : Right Mouse Button

Features:
* Autocomplete section for filter expressions or other uses
* Wheel Selector script for PCB/PCBLib selection picker
* MMB click helper (see Petar Perisin section)
* Teardrop speeder and primitive reselector
* Mouse wheel can scroll through Shift+W routing width dialog
* Rubber-stamping with net preservation (see comments in code)

; Autocomplete section for filter expressions. If you add to this, be mindful of adding enough
; characters to distinguish from common words. For example, "incomp" could start the words
; incomplete, incompetent, or the filter expression InComponent(''), whereas "incompo" is not 
; the start of any regular word in my vocabulary.

; This section makes it so that the object picker in the PCB editor can be scrolled
; with the mouse wheel, and LMB or MMB will select, and RMB will cancel the picker

; Added a differentiation between a LMB click and MMB click: Left click will now make your
; mouse return to where it was when you confirmed the picker (and bringing the picked object
; with it) rather than snapping back to the object you picked. This is mostly useful if you
; regularly drag components quickly, and resent that your drag is mostly wasted if the picker
; pops up. If you prefer to keep the default behavior, comment out this *LButton:: section
