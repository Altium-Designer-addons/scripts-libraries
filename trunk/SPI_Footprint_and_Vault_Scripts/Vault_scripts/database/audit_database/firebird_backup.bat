@rem Warning:  Because the gbak call contacts a windows service that doesn't know our current working directory, we MUST specify full paths to all files!
@rem Warning:  The Firebird service does not recognize paths on my H: drive (which is really a part of my C: drive, having run the SUBST DOS command)!
