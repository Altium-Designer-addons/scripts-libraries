------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Setup requirements
------------------
 * TortoiseSVN must be properly installed on your system. In particular,
   the Windows path must contain the TortoiseSVN binaries directory.
 * You must create a directory "C:\AltiumDesigner_Config\Scripts" on your
   system where you would store the "Libraries" folder containing the script
   dependencies.
 * It is strongly advised to install TortoiseSVN with its command-line
   binaries and configure Altium Designer to use them instead of the
   built-in Subversion client.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compatibility concerns
----------------------
 * The current version of this script is tested and works well with:
    -> Altium Designer 15.0.15 build 41991
    -> Altium Designer 14.3.17 build 42447
 * The current version of this script is tested and works well with: 
    -> TortoiseSVN 1.8.11 build 26392
 * The current version of this script is known to work under Windows 7 64-bit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to use this script
----------------------
 1) From Altium Designer, open a file or a project that is/are under version
    control with SVN.
 2) If your files contain unsaved modifications, please save them all.
 3) Run this script by the "DXP > Run Script" command and select
    TSVN_CommitFolder or TSVN_UpdateFolder, or use a dedicated menu button.
    Be sure that the visible document at the time you run the script
    is a document that you wish to update/commit.
 Note: In Update mode, all the open documents will be closed and re-opened
   after the update.
