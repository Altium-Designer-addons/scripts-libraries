NetTieLib for Altin Designer (created on AD 2013, file format IntLib, sources and sample files included)
========================================================================================================

The library NetTieLib is distributed "as is" with no warranty. The library contains special Net Tie components which are used in Altium Designer to split one signal/net into several signals/nets or join several signals/nets into one signal/net. The Net Tie component is in fact creates short circuit connection of the signals. Altium Designer do not reports those short circuit connections as DRC violation if the connection is done by the cooper parts of the Net tie component.
You can find detailed description of Net Tie components in Documentation\NetTies-and-How-to-Use-Them.pdf. The document was not written by me.
The library was created as a template. Please feel free to modify the library components according to your design standards.

The library is distributed free of charge.
