#summary Easy to use calculator for converting units

Easy to use calculator for converting units from/to the metric/imperial systems.
Originally developped by Cyril Andreattta
Improved by Justin MASSIOT

=How to use it=

 # Enter a numeric value including its unit [in, mil, mm, um], e.g. 3.1415 mm
 # Check the "copy to clipboard" checkbox if you want to directly paste the result somewhere.
 # Press enter or click the small 'Convert' button.

=Cool features=

 * Converted values will be shown in all 4 units (inch support added by version 2.0).
 * Spaces between number and unit are ignored.
 * '.' and ',' are accepted as decimal separator.
 * If unit is missing, last unit is used. This makes it easy to calculate multiple values.
And more with version 2.0:
 * The 'inch' unit is supported.
 * The result can be automatically copied to the Windows clipboard, in order to paste it wherever you want.
 * The input value is shown with a foreground color, and the copied value with a background color.
 * The converter is fully customizable for your own needs, see [mil_mm_conv#Customizing_the_converter].

=Customizing the converter=

Inside the file mil-mm-conv.pas you will find a series of constants that you can modify to fit your needs:
 * floatformat: defines the format of the decimal results; default is '0.####' (round to the fourth decimal, no trailing zeros but with a leading zero before the separator), leave this empty if you do not want to round the results
 * copybydefault: choose to copy the result to clipboard by default at startup; default is 'true' = copy by default
 * copymetric: choose the result to copy to clipboard after a conversion from imperial to metric; could be 'mm' or 'um', default is 'mm'
 * copyimperial: choose the result to copy to clipboard after a conversion from metric to imperial; could be 'mil' or 'in', default is 'mil'
 * copywithunit: choose to copy the raw value, or the value followed by the unit; default is 'false' = no unit
 * inputcolor: define the font color of the value which is the input
 * copycolor: define the background color of the result which has been copied to the clipboard; default is clSkyBlue, other proposals are clActiveCaption, clHighlight
