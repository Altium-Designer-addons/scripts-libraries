= How to commit your script and make life for other committers easy =

 * Please commit only YOUR OWN work or work which you are 100% SURE THE AUTHOR APPROVED to be shared by Altium Addons page.
 * The scripts are maintained by SVN repository. 
 * Every script has its own folder in the repository. 
 * Please test your script or other content prior commiting. Please ask someone else to test it separately if it is possible. 
 * Every commit should contain a reasonable description of changes.  
 * Every time you change some file in the script folder please ZIP the entire script folder and place the file into the downloads folder in the repository (some like to leave older files there, some not but doesn't really matter). 
 * Once the commit is done, please go to the Google Drive folder (link Download on the Addons main page) and place the ZIP file there for the people who are not using SVN. 
 * The front page with list of scripts must be maintained by the administrator. But the page itself let's the administrator know when any commit is done so the main page will be updated asap. It is not necessary to let the administrator know. 

There are usually question about modifying of code of other authors. I believe any of the authors will be proud when you push his code forward. 
 * Anybody can modify the code of anybody.
 * There is usually an author name in the code header. Leave the name there and add you name with date and short summary of the changes and added capability.
 * Test every aspect of modified script prior commit out of respect of the main author.
 * Try to really improve the functionality. 
 * Change the core function or GUI only if it is really needed out of respect for the work of main author. It means e.g. do not move a button in GUI only because you like to have it elsewhere without any other reason. Really improved ergonomics or changes because of added functionality are considered to be good reason to make any change.  
 * SVN keeps previous code revisions so we can recover previous state when some issues will be reported.
