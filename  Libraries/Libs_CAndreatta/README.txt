Words from the Author:
----------------------
Every component in our library has its own SchLib and PcbLib file. This might be good or not (discussion and opinions can be directd to cyril{at}andreatta{dot}ch). Even though the quality of the parts are not at the level of Ryan's libs, I decided to share what I've got and hope it might be useful to anybody. The parts should be error free, but it is still your own responsibility to check if it fits your own needs. There are no supplier infos of any kind, that is all handled in our database.
Any comments, improvements or bugs are welcome to the above mentioned email adress.

happy layouting,
Cyril
