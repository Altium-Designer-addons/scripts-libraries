MechLayerNames.pas
Altium version compatibility & functionality summary.

AD17, AD18
PcbDoc: 32 max mechanical layers.

Script: 1 - 32 mechanical layers partially supported (name, enabled, colour, mech pairs)
Script: 16 - 32 mech layer colours NOT supported & NOT changed.


 
AD19
PcbDoc: legacy (AD18) stack mode or 1024? max mech layers
PcbDoc: Layer type
PcbDoc: 1024? mode appears to restack existing mech layers in a "fill from the top" manner by remapping, they then appear twice (observed in my test script).

Script: legacy mode same as AD17/AD18
Script: 1024? mode appears to work same as legacy.



I think it is unwise to use the script on AD19 1024? mech layer stack setup unless
user confirms/checks result thoroughly.


Why is there a problem:
Scripting API appears to be 5 years old.
There are multiple existing alternative interfaces for Layers, all have some problems.
Most fail after eMechanical 16 or return values that crash other interfaces.
There is no support in LayerStack interface for LayerClass = eLayerClass_Mechanical, just empty..
