This is a simple script which adds a string onto a pcb at the specified location and layer.  
Allows for the changing of text size, stroke width and rotation.  This script was written primarily
as a learning exercise.  As a result it could be a good example for someone who is new to Altium 
scripting to learn from.

Written and tested in Altium Designer 19.1.7
