# Distribute Script

## What is it
This script can set the clearance or center-to-center distance between two or more tracks, and in the case of three or more tracks, can distribute the track centers or clearances evenly between the outer pair of tracks.

## How to install and use
_Step 1_: [DOWNLOAD](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/Altium-Designer-addons/scripts-libraries/tree/master/Scripts%20-%20PCB/Distribute) script

_Step 2_: integrate the script into Altium Designer and execute it.\
If you are a newcomer to Altium scripts, [please read the "how to" wiki page](https://github.com/Altium-Designer-addons/scripts-libraries/wiki/HowTo_execute_scripts).

## Usage guide
_Eligible objects_: Select two or more parallel tracks.\
_Invoke script_ and choose relevant operation from GUI.
### Distribute by Clearance
_Distribute by Clearance_ will make the clearance distance between all tracks equal, without moving the outer 2 tracks. Requires 3 or more parallel tracks.
### Distribute by Centerlines
_Distribute by Centerlines_ will make pitch of all tracks equal, without moving the outer 2 tracks. If tracks are different widths, they will necessarily have different gaps. Requires 3 or more parallel tracks.
### Distribute Clearances by value
_Distribute Clearances by value_ will set the clearance of tracks to the user-specified value, without moving the first track.
### Distribute Centers by value
_Distribute Centers by value_ will set the centerlines of tracks to the user-specified pitch, without moving the first track.
### Which one is the First Track?
For the _FWD_ Direction mode, _First Track_ depends on the direction the tracks are running:\
* For horizontal tracks, the lowest track is first.
* For vertical tracks, the leftmost track is first.
* For tracks rotated anti-clockwise from vertical, the leftmost track is first.
* For tracks rotated clockwise from vertical, the rightmost track is first.

For the _REV_ Direction mode, the order above is reversed.

For the _CEN_ Direction mode, _First Track_ is either the middle track if there are an odd number of tracks, or it is the ***(N/2)***_-th_ track.

## Features

### Direction of distribution
_FWD_ behaves as described above, which is the same behavior as previous versions of the script.\
_CEN_ redistributes tracks from the center of extents. For example, a pair of tracks will move symmetrically. The center line is halfway between the outer pair of tracks.\
_REV_ will reverse the direction of distribution i.e. what would normally be the last track is instead the first track.
### Changing Units
When one of the by-value options is active, clicking the "mil" label next to the input value will change it to "MM" and vice versa.
### Presets
When one of the by-value options is active, 8 user preset values are available. Editing a preset value and pressing Enter, or pressing the corresponding button will run the distribute command with that value.
### Trim Unconnected Track Ends
If checked, any unconnected track ends will be trimmed to be perpendicular with the respective end of the _First Track_. Note that since this will lengthen _or_ shorten tracks, you can use this to adjust only the _First Track_ to your desired cut line and the rest will adjust to match it.
### Debug Logging
If script is launched using the _StartWithDebug_ procedure, it will save before-and-after data for each track that is distributed.\
Debug file is saved in **`%appdata%\Altium\Altium Designer {installation ID}\DistributeScriptDebug.csv`**

## Known Issues
### Rounding errors with tracks that aren't at 90/45 angles
Sometimes, particularly when distributing tracks that are not routed at 90째 or 45째 angles, rounding errors can occur due to precision of double data type and Altium TCoord unit resolution. Errors up to 0.002mil have been observed.
### Tracks that are nearly, but not quite, vertical
Tracks with a slope greater than 20 (90째 > angle > ~87.137째) will be coerced to be perfectly vertical. This is a limitation of the Double number type. In short, angles that are too steep will have Y-intercept values that are too large to handle.

## Change log
2022-11-02 by Ryan Rutledge : v1.3 - Added support for up to 8 user presets for by-value inputs; remembers last-used by-value input

2022-11-06 by Ryan Rutledge : v1.4 - Remembers last-used distribute mode if valid; added support for distributing tracks by-value in different working directions

2022-11-16 by Ryan Rutledge : v1.41 - Added ability to trim dangling track ends perpendicular to _First Track_

2022-11-17 by Ryan Rutledge : v1.42 - added version to form

2022-11-17 by Ryan Rutledge : v1.43 - added debugging tools; fixed TargetSlope getting reset for each track instead of set once by _First Track_

2022-11-18 by Ryan Rutledge : v1.44 - fixed bug where near-vertical tracks wouldn't trim properly if ends were normalized; fixed overflow error for steep angles; fixed invalid distribution if tracks are near vertical and are coerced to vertical
