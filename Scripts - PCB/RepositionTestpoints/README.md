# Reposition Testpoints
Place testpoints in bulk without having to scroll over and manually select each testpoint.  

## Usage
Select an object with a net  
The corresponding testpoint with a matching net is selected  
Component will be moved to your cursor for placement  

### Notes      
Testpoints that are locked or already placed on their net will not be selected  

Hold Shift to select multiple nets before placement  

Hold Ctrl to allow selecting testpoints which are already placed  

### Assumptions
It is assumed that all testpoints contain a Pad with an assigned net and use the designator prefix 'TP'  

### Issues
When a net has multiple testpoints the script may not select the desired  
testpoint, as it just grabs the first free testpoint it finds with the net.  

When checking if testpoints are already placed, checking against polygons is not perfect.  
Irregularly shaped polygon areas are natively converted to a virtual rectangle prior  
to checking for overlap with the testpoint pad. Along with this, polygons are assumed  
to have copper in the entire virtual area. Thus, the script can inaccurately assume  
testpoints are placed when they may not actually be in contact with copper.
