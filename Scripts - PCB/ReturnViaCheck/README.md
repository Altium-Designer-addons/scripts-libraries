# What This Script Is
This script is a utility tool to help detect high-speed signal vias without a nearby return via.

## Why?
When a high-speed (or RF) signal's route changes layers, the reference plane for the signal also changes. Just as the incident signal requires a via to change layers, so too does the "return" signal need a path between reference planes.

## How to install and use
_Step 1_: [DOWNLOAD](https://altium-designer-addons.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/Altium-Designer-addons/scripts-libraries/tree/master/Scripts+-+PCB/ReturnViaCheck) script

_Step 2_: integrate the script into Altium Designer and execute it.\
If you are a newcomer to Altium scripts, [please read the "how to" wiki page](https://github.com/Altium-Designer-addons/scripts-libraries/wiki/HowTo_execute_scripts).

## Usage guide
### USE THE GUI
- Accessed by launching `_GUI` script procedure

### Configuration/Editing GUI
![GUI Screenshot](ReturnViaCheck_GUI.png)

### **ENABLE VIAS IN SELECTION FILTER**
Script will detect if this is not the case.

## Features
### Stackup-Based Via Connection Checking
- User tags Reference layers in stackup visualization
- Each layer will have up to 2 reference layers:
  - First reference layer will be the nearest layer tagged as REF, regardless of distance or of any intervening layers (user may have intervening layers cut away or not actually routed)
  - Second reference layer will be the nearest layer **on the opposite side** from the first reference layer, **IF** it is within 2X the first reference layer's distance from signal layer.
    - 2X factor is the default value but can be configured by text-editing the configuration file (click version number in GUI to view path to config file)
    - 2X factor is based on the fact that coupling will be dominantly to the closer layer (first reference). For an example, a 50 ohm unbalanced stripline's impedance changes by <1% when when the farther reference layer changes from 2X to 2.1X distance:

- If connected signal layers share a single common reference layer, no via is necessary. Example: L2 is reference, L1 and L3 both only reference L2, and signal via is only connected on L1 and L3.
- Click on `?` to see how reference layers have been interpreted based on user's REF tags and stackup thicknesses:

- When a layer is considered "Connected":
  - Via exists on that layer (has a pad larger than drill hole) and has a track, arc, region, fill, polygon, or pad connected to it
  - Via has a plane connection on that layer
### Recall Previous Selections
When GUI is launched, selections from previous check will be restored. Net/Class/Drill Pair/Layer names must match exactly else defaults will be used. Works best between checks on the same board.
### Filter Signal & Return Vias
- Filter signal vias by net or net class
- Filter return vias by net or net class
- Filter return vias by Drill Pair
### Failed Vias Added to Messages Panel
Failed vias will be listed in Messages panel. These messages can be used to jump to specific vias.
### Custom Violations
- Check the `Custom Violations` box in the GUI to add (somewhat) custom violations for failed vias
- If `Custom Violations` is **ENABLED**, via return checks will modify the PcbDoc to add and remove custom rules and violations
- Custom violations use the Hole To Hole violations formatting (you will see violations like "Hole To Hole Clearance Constraint: (Collision < 35 mil)...") for failing vias
- This turns on DRC violation overlay for those vias and allows navigating them with the PCB Rules And Violations panel
- If not used, failed vias will only be highlighted and selected

## Eligible Objects
Vias

## Known Issues
### Return via drill pair eligibility
- Defaults to full-stack at start, but user can select other drill pairs in the layer stack to consider.
- In `Drill Pairs` Via Check Mode, return via drill pair eligibility is not validated i.e. user can select drill pairs that aren't _**actually**_ going to provide a return path - the script will still treat them as valid returns if they are close enough.

# INITIAL REQUIREMENTS SPEC
## Non-Modal GUI
- [x] Non-modal so that findings can be addressed without restarting the script (better UX)
## Configurable check distance
- [x] If any eligible return via exists within range, via passes check
- [x] If no eligible return via exists within range, add signal via to a list of vias that failed check
- [x] Support either metric or imperial units
## Other potential filter criteria? - SUBMIT AN ISSUE if you strongly want one of these
- [ ] Filter by min >< max via hole size?
- [ ] Filter signal via by separate drill pair list?
- [ ] Filter by what the via is connected to (track/pad/region)?
- [ ] Filter by hole type (via/pad)?
## Filter vias by Specific Net, Net Class, or All Nets
- [x] Options to signal return vias by All Nets, Specific Net, or Net Class
- [x] Options to filter return vias by Specific Net or by Net Class (not all nets)
- [x] Option to filter return vias by Drill Pair
- [x] Multiselection only for net classes because of likelihood of huge count of individual nets
- [x] Selected return nets are ignored
- [ ] Ignore any vias without a trace wired up to them?
  - [ ] return vias can have traces wired up to them
  - [ ] vias of both types could have vias in pad without any traces wired
- [ ] should through-hole pads be considered? I'm leaning toward no but maybe this has value?
## Issues to do with stackups and drill pairs
- [x] `Use Stackup` Via Check Mode should analyze actual via connections to verify that the used signal layers' references are connected together
## Dedicated list of nets to exclude?
- [ ] Same potential multiselection problem as above (would probably only make sense to allow selecting net classes to excludes)
## Save states between runs
- [x] Lists of nets/classes could be challenging - looks for exact match from last check
- [x] Needs to not break if netlist changes (eg. with different board or just a netlist change) - will only restore if all saved values exist
- [ ] Would be nice to save state for a few "recent" boards, but probably not worth implementation effort
## Buttons to Check All, Recheck, and Clear Results
- [x] Check All button: checks all vias. After clicking, selected filter settings are locked until clear results button is used
- [x] Recheck button: (for performance reasons) only repeats check on vias in failed via list. If any now pass, list will be updated
- [x] Clear Results button: Implemented as "Check All" changing to "Restart"; clears failed via list and unlocks selection filters again
## Zoom to failing vias button?
- [ ] Clears selection, selects all failing vias, zooms to selection, then clears selection again
## "Next" and "Previous" buttons to step through the list of failed vias
- [x] Only active while list of fails is not empty
- [x] There should be a button to ignore via that removes via from list of fails as if it were rechecked and passed
- [x] There should also be a button to "Zoom" on and select the current via from the list in case user pans away
