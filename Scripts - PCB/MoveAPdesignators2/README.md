# MoveAPdesignators2
This script will change auto-positioned designators to manual and move them by a user-defined amount. Will operate on all or selected components.\
The direction of the movement depends on the current autoposition status.

*Taken from original MoveAPdesignators script*

- Added ability to set justification anchor so that changes to designator size or length grow in the same direction AutoPosition would grow (manual but smarter)
- Added 8 configurable preset values
- Remembers last-used settings
- Works in AD 22.8.2+, not sure exactly what version introduced text justification for single strings
