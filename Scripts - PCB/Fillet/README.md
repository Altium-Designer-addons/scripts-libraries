## Usage guide
_Eligible objects_: two or more tracks with _exactly_ joined vertices\
_Ineligible objects_: any non-track objects will be deselected when script is launched\
_Invoke script_ and choose relevant operation from GUI. Pressing <Enter> in any value field will execute the fillet operation.
### Fixed Radius
_"mils" or "mm"_ will fillet selected tracks with an arc of the specified radius. Can exceed limit and reverse direction of track(s).
### Percentage
_"%"_ will create a radius that will shorten the shorter of two joined tracks by the indicated percentage. May have unintended behavior when multiple tracks in series are selected.
### Changing Units
Default setting is fixed radius in mils. Value presets are unitless.
### Using Presets
Press the preset button (or Alt+Number) to execute the fillet operation with that value. Pressing <Enter> while editing a preset will immediately execute that preset and save it.
### Saving Presets
Preset values are saved _every_ time you execute the fillet command, if you change a preset value. Does _not_ save if you cancel the dialog.\
Unit and last used radius will be saved too.
