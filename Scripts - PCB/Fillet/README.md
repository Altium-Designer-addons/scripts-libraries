Edited 2018-09-15 to support any-angle tracks and fixed radius\
Edited 2022-08-01 to add 8 configurable preset radius values\
Edited 2022-08-06 to cleanup TStringList object methods etc.


## Usage guide
_Eligible objects_: two or more tracks with _exactly_ joined vertices\
_Ineligible objects_: any non-track objects will be deselected when script is launched\
_Invoke script_ and choose relevant operation from GUI.
### Fixed Radius
_"mils" or "mm"_ will fillet selected tracks with an arc of the specified radius. Can exceed limit and reverse direction of track(s).
### Percentage
_"%"_ will create a radius that will shorten the shorter of two joined tracks by the indicated percentage. May have unintended behavior when multiple tracks in series are selected.
### Changing Units
Default setting is fixed radius in mils. Value presets are unitless.
