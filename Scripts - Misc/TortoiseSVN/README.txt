What does this script do
-------------------
 * TSVN_CommitFolder is a function to commit a project, with extended features compared to the built-in function of Altium:
   -> it works on all the content of the project folder, not only the files contained in the Altium project
   -> it warns the user before committing if unsaved modifications are detected (everyone hates to forget to save just before a commit)
   -> it automatically refreshes the SVN icons at the end of the operation
 * TSVN_UpdateFolder is a function to update a project, with extended features compared to the built-in function of Altium:
   -> it works on all the content of the project folder, not only the files contained in the Altium project
   -> it does not update if unsaved modifications are detected on any file
   -> it closes and re-open all the project files that were previously open to be sure to work on the all fresh files

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to use this script
----------------------
 1) From Altium Designer, open a file or a project that is/are under version
    control with SVN.
 2) If your files contain unsaved modifications, please save them all.
 3) With your document currently visible, run this script by one of
    this three means:
    a) Using a custom menu dedicated to SVN actions described at
         https://github.com/Altium-Designer-addons/scripts-libraries/blob/master/UI%20customizations/Menu_SVN/README.md
    b) Creating a custom menu button with Process set to
         ScriptingSystem:RunScript
       and Parameters set to something like
         ProjectName=[*PathToPrjScr*]|ProcName=[*PathToTheCurrentFile*]>[*NameOfTheFunction*]
    c) Opening the PrjScr project, then click on "DXP > Run Script" and select
       TSVN_CommitFolder or TSVN_UpdateFolder.
    Be sure that the visible document at the time you run the script
    is a document that you wish to update/commit.
 Note: In Update mode, all the open documents will be closed and re-opened
   after the update.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Setup requirements
------------------
 * TortoiseSVN must be properly installed on your system. In particular,
   the Windows path must contain the TortoiseSVN binaries directory.
 * The project file (*.PrjScr) associated with your script must include
   the following dependencies contained in the "Libraries" folder:
   - Lib_FileManagement.vbs
   - Lib_AltiumFunctions.vbs
   - Lib_VBScriptAdditions.vbs
 * It is strongly advised to install TortoiseSVN with its command-line
   binaries and configure Altium Designer to use them instead of the
   built-in Subversion client.
