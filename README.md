# Community add-ons for Altium Designer

## What is it
This is a set of addons for Altium Designer, a CAD software for Electronic designers. This project contains some scripts, examples and other content which has been developed by community members to provide extended features for Altium Designer.\
No real consistency exists between each script because they have been developed separately by individual developers. You can use only one script out of the full set if you want.

## How to use
_Step 1_: download the add-on you want.
1. Either clone the entire set of add-ons on your computer (if you're accustomed to Git),
2. Or download only the add-on you want. You can do so by navigating into a script folder and then clicking the script link from the list.

_Step 2_: integrate the script into Altium Designer and execute it.\
If you are a newcomer to Altium scripts, [please read the "how to" help page](https://github.com/Altium-Designer-addons/scripts-libraries/blob/master/HowTo_execute_scripts.md). Some developers may also have provided some screen captures or examples of use.

__Please be advised__: Some scripts may not work out-of-the-box. Some may be old, unmaintained. Others may be provided as a demonstration, or should be integrated in an other script to fully work.
